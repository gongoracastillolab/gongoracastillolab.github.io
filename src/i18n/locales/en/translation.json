She then pursued postdoctoral fellowships at Michigan State University and North Carolina State University, gaining bioinformatics and functional genomics expertise. Upon returning to Mexico, she joined the Center for Scientific Research of Yucatán (CICY) as part of the \"Investigadoras e Investigadores por México\" program. Currently, she leads this laboratory at Cinvestav Mérida, focusing on understanding the molecular defense and adaptation mechanisms to climate change of coastal and terrestrial organisms."
