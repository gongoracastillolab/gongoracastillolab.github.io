  "description": "\"The laboratory integrates genomics, bioinformatics, and talent development to generate knowledge that bridges fundamental science with solutions to environmental and productive challenges in southeastern Mexico.\"\n\nThe Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics Laboratory, led by Dr. Elsa Góngora Castillo, is part of the Department of Marine Resources at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (Cinvestav-IPN), Mérida Unit, located in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico.\n\nOur research program focuses on understanding the molecular responses and genomic adaptations during interactions with pathogenic organisms and environmental changes in coastal and terrestrial organisms, primarily plants and animals. We aim to unravel the mechanisms of molecular defense systems and their genetic regulation using advanced high-throughput sequencing strategies and bioinformatics tools.",
