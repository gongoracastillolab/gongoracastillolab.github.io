  "historyTitle": "A Brief History of the Laboratory",
  "historyContent": "The Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics was founded in 2016 by Dr. Elsa Góngora-Castillo following her return to Mexico. She completed her doctoral studies at the Genetic Engineering Unit of Cinvestav Irapuato, Guanajuato. She later pursued postdoctoral training at Michigan State University and North Carolina State University, where she strengthened her expertise in bioinformatics, functional genomics, and large-scale data analysis.\n\nUpon her return, she joined the Center for Scientific Research of Yucatán (CICY) as part of the Investigadoras e Investigadores por México program, where the foundations of the laboratory were established. The group later consolidated within the Department of Marine Resources at Cinvestav Mérida, positioning itself as a regional reference for bioinformatics analysis of genomes, transcriptomes, and metagenomes.\n\nOver a decade of continuous work, the laboratory has trained multiple generations of bioinformaticians and genomic data specialists, actively contributing to the professionalization of large-scale data analysis in southeastern Mexico. Its research has advanced the understanding of molecular defense mechanisms and adaptive processes in terrestrial and coastal organisms of the Yucatán Peninsula, with implications for conservation, food security, and biotechnological innovation.\n\nWith a forward-looking vision focused on multi-omics integration, open science, and training of highly specialized talent, the laboratory continues to consolidate as a space for academic leadership and knowledge generation with regional and international impact."
